/**
 * Value resolver is a <em>pluggable</em> component that can be used to resolve instances
 * of any type based on metadata.
 *
 * <p> Main purpose is to provide a flexible resolution algorithm to the {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.AutoBuilder}. Value resolvers can be combined or
 * chained to achieve complex and completely configurable strategies for instance
 * resolution. The ultimate goal of {@code AutoBuilder} is to be able to resolve objects
 * of <em>any java type</em>.
 *
 * <h3>Types of resolvers</h3>
 *
 * <p> Resolver implementations are free to choose whatever resolution approach is needed.
 * <em id="greedy_resolver">Greedy</em> resolvers would resolve as many types as they can
 * and are best suited as the most generic resolvers that are tried if the type cannot be
 * setResolved by any other more specific resolver. An example are the <em
 * id="builtin_resolver">built-in resolvers</em> that can resolve some common types and
 * their supertypes from {@link java.lang} and {@link java.util}.
 *
 * <p> <em id="general_resolver">General</em> resolvers resolve only single, usually
 * common type (directly from JDK or from a well known library), and are meant to be
 * widely used. Example would be {@link java.math.BigDecimal} and {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.resolvers.BigDecimalResolver}.
 *
 * <p> <em id="specific_resolver">Specific</em> resolvers may be used to resolve types
 * specific for a given test case or to override other resolvers to resolve a common type
 * in a specific way. Their usage depends on use case, and they will often be used as a
 * local configuration - see {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(ValueResolver)}.
 *
 * <p> <em id="bean_resolver">Bean resolver</em> is a special resolver within the {@code
 * AutoBuilder} library that is invoked when the type cannot be setResolved by any other
 * registered resolver. It first tries to instantiate the target type, and then tries to
 * resolve each property of the resulting object recursively using the same resolution
 * process that was used to resolve the original type. It may happen that the target type
 * cannot be instantiated, and in this case the {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#build()} will fail with an
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <h3 id="resolution_process">Resolution process</h3>
 *
 * <p> The actual resolution of an instance with the {@code AutoBuilder} is implemented
 * using the <em>chain of responsibility</em> pattern. Known resolvers are tried one by
 * one and the first one that is able to handle the resolution request is used. The chain
 * of resolvers is composed of two parts - local part and global part. The local part is
 * specific to each {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL} and is fully
 * specified by the user, without affecting other {@code BuilderDSL} objects. The global
 * part, on the other hand, is managed by the {@code AutoBuilder} class and is supplied to
 * every {@code BuilderDSL} object as it is created.
 *
 * <p> The resolution process first tries the local resolvers, and then the global ones.
 * In addition to that, each sub-chain begins with a special resolver that is tried first
 * and that contains specific 'named values', which allow the user to quickly specify
 * plain value-based overrides without the need to implement a full {@code ValueResolver}.
 * To contribute to these named values, use {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(String, Object)}, or {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(java.util.Map)} (local part), and
 * {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.AutoBuilder#registerValue(String, Object,
 * Annotation...)} (global part). After these named values, in each (local and global)
 * sub-chain, custom user registered resolvers are tried in a LIFO manner (last
 * registered resolver is tried first).
 *
 * <p> If none of these resolvers can handle the request, the {@code AutoBuilder} then
 * proceeds with the <a href="#builtin_resolver">built-in resolvers</a> and the <a
 * href="#bean_resolver">bean resolver</a>. So, in the end the resolution process looks
 * like this:
 * <pre>
 * Resolver Chain
 * ├── Local resolvers (per each {@code BuilderDSL}, mostly <a href="#specific_resolver">specific</a>)
 * │   ├── Named values (specified using {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(String, Object)} or {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(Map)}
 * │   ├── User resolver 1 (specified using {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.api.BuilderDSL#with(ValueResolver)}
 * │   ├── User resolver 2
 * │   └── ...
 * ├── Global resolvers (available to every {@code BuilderDSL}, mostly <a href="#general_resolver">general</a>)
 * │   ├── Global named values (specified using {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.AutoBuilder#registerValue(String, Object, Annotation...)})
 * │   ├── Global user resolver 1 (specified using {@link com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.AutoBuilder#registerResolver(ValueResolver)}
 * │   ├── Global user resolver 2
 * │   └── ...
 * ├── Built-in resolvers (non-customizable, available off-the-shelf, <a href="#greedy_resolver">greedy</a>)
 * │   ├── String resolver
 * │   ├── Primitive types resolver
 * │   ├── Enum resolver
 * │   ├── Collection resolver
 * │   └── Array resolver
 * └── <a href="#bean_resolver">Bean resolver</a>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Resolvers available off-the-shelf</h3>
 *
 * <p> Resolvers that come with the {@code AutoBuilder} library are the built-in resolvers
 * shown in the previous section, and any additional resolvers from the package {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.resolvers}. No special configuration is required to
 * use them. Also note that, as already mentioned in <a
 * href="../api/BuilderDSL.html#value_resolution"> BuilderDSL</a>, the exact result of
 * these resolvers in not specified, as the goal is to provide whatever instance that is
 * valid within a given test case (the test does not fail because of e.g. {@code
 * java.lang.NullPointerException}), but completely irrelevant for the result of the test
 * (choosing any other valid instance would yield the same test result).
 *
 * <h3>How to register a resolver</h3>
 *
 * <p> Registering an additional custom resolver of a given type using the {@code
 * AutoBuilder} API is described in detail in the <a href="#resolution_process">resolution
 * process</a> section. In addition to that, the JDK's {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}
 * framework can be used to load implementations of {@code ValueResolver}s. These
 * resolvers will be registered as global ones, exactly like if {@link
 * com.github.jakubkolar.autobuilder.AutoBuilder#registerResolver(ValueResolver)} was
 * used. This way, the {@code AutoBuilder} can be enhanced by new features just by adding
 * classes or third-party libraries to the classpath, without any additional configuration
 * in the existing code. <a href="https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service"
 * >AutoService</a> library can be used to simplify configuration of the
 * {@code ServiceLoader}.
